						<p><strong>Inventory Clerk<br>
							</strong>An employee of Gps Inventory</p>
						<p><strong>Property Inventories<br>
							</strong>Gps Inventory provides inventories, check-in reports, check-out reports,
							mid-term reports and snagging reports for estate agents, private landlords and tenants
							across the Gps of England.</p>
						<p><strong>Report<br>
							</strong>Any document prepared by Gps Inventory on behalf of a client – this will be
							an inventory, check-in report, check-out report, mid term or interim inspection or a
							snagging report.</p>
						<p><strong>Services<br>
							</strong>The Report provides an unbiased record of (i) the contents of the property, (ii)
							the condition of the contents and (iii) the property’s internal condition as at the date of
							the report and is undertaken by an Inventory Clerk acting as an independent third
							party.&nbsp; The Inventory Clerk is not a qualified surveyor, nor an expert in antiques,
							fabrics, woods, metals etc.&nbsp; The Report is not an accurate description of every piece
							of furniture and equipment, nor is it a structural survey and cannot be relied upon as
							such.&nbsp; An opinion as to whether the items recorded in the Report are replica,
							reproduced or genuine is not being offered.</p>
						<p>The Report is not a guarantee of, nor a report on, the functionality or safety of any of the
							property’s contents, but merely a statement that the contents were viewed in the property at
							the time the Report was undertaken.</p>
						<p><strong>Instructions<br>
							</strong>Gps Inventory can take instructions by telephone, email, letter or
							SMS.&nbsp; Once an instruction to prepare a report is received, by e-mail, telephone, letter
							or SMS, an agreement is deemed to exist between Gps Inventory and the instructing
							party under these terms and conditions.</p>
						<p>Bookings can often be accommodated at short notice or even on the same day, but it is
							advisable to give as much notice as possible to secure the time slot that you
							want.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that it is particularly busy around month-ends, at weekends and
							over the summer, so if you can arrange appointments outside these times, there is a greater
							chance of flexibility on available times.</p>
						<p>If the client appoints an agent to act as their representative, it is the responsibility of
							any such instructing agent to advise their client of these terms and conditions.</p>
						<p>Where an email address is provided by the client, Gps Inventory will send an automated
							email to that email address confirming the booking.</p>
						<p><strong>Opening Hours<br>
							</strong>The main office of Gps Inventory is open from 9am to 9pm from Monday to
							Friday and Saturday 10am to 3pm.&nbsp; Bookings are undertaken by Gps Inventory
							during these hours.&nbsp; It may be possible to arrange out-of-hours appointments (late
							evenings, Sundays or bank holidays) by prior arrangement and at additional charge.</p>
						<p><strong>Report<br>
							</strong>Gps Inventory is committed to providing a green and paperless service to the
							fullest extent possible.&nbsp; Accordingly, we encourage all of our clients to make bookings
							by email and to accept PDF copies of reports whenever possible.&nbsp; Gps Inventory
							will provide up to 3 printed copies of the reports to one UK address if requested.&nbsp;
							Further copies are available at additional charge.</p>
						<p><strong>Turnaround Time<br>
							</strong>Gps Inventory is committed to providing reports the same day of the visit to
							the property whenever possible.&nbsp; This target is achieved approximately 90% of the
							time.&nbsp; If you require a report to be turned around urgently please advise Gps
							Inventory at the time of booking and we will do our best to accommodate your request.</p>
						<p><strong>Amendments<br>
							</strong>Amendments are inevitably occasionally required to reports – if you require any
							amendments to be made, please submit these to Gps Inventory by email within five
							business days of receipt of the Report.&nbsp; If the amendments are as a result of NE
							Inventory making an error or omission, additional copies of the Report will be supplied in
							either paper or electronic form.&nbsp; If substantial changes are required to the report
							(e.g. because the property has been decorated or furnished since our visit), NE Inventory
							reserve the right to revisit the property in order to inspect the changes before amending
							the report – additional charges would apply in this case.</p>
						<p><strong>Charges<br>
							</strong>Current charges are set out on the website at <a title="www.gpsinventories/prices"
								href="http://www.gpsinventories.co.uk/prices">www.gpsinventories.co.uk/prices</a>.&nbsp;Our
							prices DO NOT vary according to the size of the property and location in the UK.&nbsp;
							Prices assume that the property is furnished to a ‘rental furnished’ standard, meaning that
							the property has what we consider to be a typical amount of furniture for a rental
							property.&nbsp; Similarly, the property is assumed to have a standard number of rooms for
							the prices that we charge per bedroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prices are subject to change without
							prior notice.</p>
						<p>Please note that VAT is not payable in addition to the base price.</p>
						<p>Please note that the following extra charges may apply:</p>
						<p>Furniture – Please note that ‘rental furnished’ assumes that the property is lightly
							furnished for rental purposes. If the property is heavily furnished, NE Inventory reserves
							the right to increase the charges to reflect the extra time incurred. Typically, this occurs
							when there are a large number of utensils in the kitchen, or significant amounts of
							ornaments or furniture in the house.</p>
						<p>Extra Rooms –&nbsp;Our pricing assumes that the property contains one reception room, one
							bathroom, one toilet and one kitchen. If there are additional rooms, there will be an
							additional charge of £10 per room.</p>
						<p>Travel –&nbsp;Our pricing assume that that inventory is undertaken where public transport is
							good to within ten minutes walk of the property. If this is not the case, please call us to
							discuss and an additional charge may apply.</p>
						<p><strong>Invoices<br>
							</strong>Zero VAT invoices will be raised at the same time as the report is printed (whether
							electronically or in paper form) for the client.&nbsp; The invoice will be distributed in
							the same manner as the report – either in paper form accompanying the report, or
							electronically with the PDF report.</p>
						<p><strong>Payment<br>
							</strong>Payment can be made by any of the following methods: direct bank transfer to the
							bank account details on the invoice, &nbsp;cash given to the clerk on the day of the visit
							or by Barclays Pingit using 07811 337 222.</p>
						<p>It is the responsibility of the instructing party to settle payment for any reports or
							charges incurred.</p>
						<p>Payment of invoices is to be made strictly within 14 days of receipt.&nbsp; NE Inventory
							reserves the right to charge interest at 4% above the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC base rate
							if payment is not received within this time.</p>
						<p>Gps Inventory reserves the right to withhold any documentation not fully paid for by
							the instructing party. Where the instructing party is in arrears NE Inventories may withhold
							such documentation or reports it deems fit, until such arrears are settled in full.</p>
						<p><strong>Exclusions<br>
							</strong>Please note that NE Inventory takes the health and safety of our employees very
							seriously.&nbsp; The Inventory Clerk is not required to undertake appointments under any
							circumstances in which they feel threatened, unsafe or in danger in any way
							whatsoever.&nbsp; The instructing party has a duty of care to ensure that the property is
							safe and to warn NE Inventory of any potential hazards around the property that should be
							avoided.&nbsp; Please also note the following exclusions:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>No requirement to inspect loft areas.</li>
							<li>No requirement to inspect cellars unless they are accessible by a staircase, properly
								lit and constitute a proper room to be included in the tenancy.</li>
							<li>No requirement to inspect infested properties (e.g. with rodents, insects etc)</li>
							<li>No requirement to move heavy items of furniture including appliances, beds and sofas
							</li>
							<li>Mattresses will only be moved and inspected where the clerk is safely able to do so</li>
							<li>No requirement to inspect any cupboard or storage areas above reasonable head height
							</li>
							<li>No requirement to read meters above head height (please note that we may be able to take
								a picture of the meter in such cases and take the reading from that, depending on the
								circumstances)</li>
							<li>No requirement to read meters in a cellar or in areas under steps where it would be
								required to climb over rubbish or stored items to reach them</li>
							<li>No requirement to inspect locked rooms or packed boxes</li>
							<li>No requirement to enter a property with a dog or any other animal present unless the
								owner is also present and the clerk is satisfied that the animal is completely under
								control.</li>
							<li>Lights are checked for working order only. Gas, electrical appliances, fire alarms
								and/or smoke detectors are not tested. Under no circumstance is the inventory clerk able
								to provide a qualified opinion of the property’s gas safety profile. Nor is it the
								responsibility of the Gps Inventory to schedule an inspection from a gas safe
								registered engineer. The report is unable to provide any qualified opinion on the
								property’s electrical safety profile.</li>
							<li>No requirement to ensure items comply with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety)
								Regulations. Comments found in the inventory such as ‘FFR label seen’ (or similar) give
								no guarantee of the item’s compliance with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety)
								regulations.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Cancellation Policy<br>
							</strong>By agreeing to accept an appointment from a client, NE Inventory is reserving a
							time slot and turning away other potential business from that time slot. Therefore, if the
							visit is cancelled by the client for any reason the following charges will apply:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If the visit is cancelled on the day of the visit (including e.g. if keys are not
								available or the resident is not home to allow the Inventory Clerk access to the
								property), the full fee will be payable.</li>
							<li>If the visit is cancelled after 12pm, on the day prior to the visit, a fee of 50% of the
								charge will be payable.</li>
							<li>If the visit is cancelled before 12pm on the day prior to the visit, no fee will be
								payable.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong>Liability<br>
							</strong>The liability of Gps Inventory is capped at three times the amount of the
							report being prepared under all circumstances.</p>
						<p><strong>Complaints<br>
							</strong>If you have a complaint, you should send this by email as soon as possible after
							the date of the report to <a
								href="mailto:hello@gpsinventories.co.uk">hello@gpsinventories.co.uk</a>.&nbsp;Your
							complaint will be fully examined and responded to within two weeks of receipt.</p>
